# **Evaluation of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for dimensionality reduction for large geochemical datasets relevant to magmatic ore-fertility, petrologic classification, and provenance**

## Instructions
This repository contains jupyter notebooks that can be downloaded and run on the users computer. After downloading, users will need to update the directories in the code and then follow the instructions within the notebooks. 
Users can also transform their own datasets using the V3_zirconfertility UMAP script and saved UMAP model by inputting their datasets provided they are in the same format (same columns). 

## Contents
This repository contains scripts used to project mineral trace element geochemical data using UMAP. Commented instructions can be found within the linked jupyter notebooks The linked paper () and scripts uses existing literature compilations of apatite and zircon geochemistry from Carrasco-Godoy et al., 2024 (https://doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.5086) ; Nathwani et al., 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-52786-5), Castellanos-Melendez et al., 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.119053), and O'Sullivan et al., 2020, downloaded from their PANGAEA repository (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.906570).

* The folder labelled V3_zirconfertility contains the script, data, and UMAP model used to project zircon geochemistry using Eu/Eu*, λ3, P, Dy/Yb, λ2, Ce/Nd, Eu, Tb, Gd, and Gd/Yb.

* The folder labelled V3_zircongeochemistry contains the script, data, and UMAP model used to project zircon geochemistry using P, Ce, Eu, Th, La, Pr, Y, Nd, Gd, Er, Yb, Sm, Dy, and Lu.

* The folder labelled Yerington contains the scripts and data used to construct the Yerington district figures.

* The apatite folder contains the script and dataset used to project the apatite data of O'Sullivan et al., 2020.
